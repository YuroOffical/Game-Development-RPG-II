## Description
The Game i Created During Semester Two, 
for this one, i focuses on the backend


## Information
Created using Winform as the base of the program and Krita for the artwork
Most of the code was written by me with my team helping with SQL and Artwork
It uses code to generate moving images as using Gif would cause too much lag for winform
Several QoL Classes Like File Editor, File Reader, Animation using Async Commands
It Contains a SQL to Winform converter to make ease of operation between 2 of them
